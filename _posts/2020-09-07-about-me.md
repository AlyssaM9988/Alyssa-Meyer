## Academic life
In the spring of 2019 I was accepted to Christopher Newport University! CNU had everything that I wanted. It had amazing academic programs, a small campus, great food, and an atmosphere where volunteering is part of campus life! My main academic major is Accounting but I am also double majoring in Finance as well. I have always been good with numbers and quick mental math. I am now a sophomore in college and I just applied ot the [Luter School of Business](https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/business/) where I will be completing my degree! 


After my first year at CNU I got an externship at [Yount Hyde and Barbour](https://www.yhbcpa.com) where I was then offered an accounting internship for the summer of 2021! YHB is part of my hometown and has business in several different areas including Richmond. This internship gives a doorway into the accounting world and as a sophomore in college I am thankful to YHB for seeing the potential in me and giving me this wonderful opportunity!
## Why I took DH
Like I said my major is Accounting and Finance and when I was looking for classes that counted towards my writing intensive credit I read the descriptions and I was looking for a class out of my comfort zone. I wanted a class that would challenge me to think in a completely different way than I would in my classes towards my major. When I found a class that required creativity and the use of technology I was automatically intrigued.
## Volunteering
Volunteering is important to me personally because I love giving back to the community that surrounds CNU. CNU has made it easy to find ways to volunteer! I volunteer a few times a week at an on-campus job. My job is at the Judy Ford Wason Center for Public Policy also known as the [Wason Center](https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter).


Here we get volunteer hours for being a student researcher. To get these volunteer hours we call randomly generated numbers and ask participants to take a non-partisan poll about different issues in the world whether it be about the next upcoming election or about environmental issues.
## Home Life
> *"You is Kind. You is Strong. You is Important."*

My life has revolved around this quote since the first time I saw the movie "The Help." Everynight before my mom would tuck me and my sister in she said this phrase to both of us. She always wanted to remind us that we were loved and that we are significant. This has shaped my life and because of my mom doing that she taught us to be confident in everything we do. 


This is me and my mom! I am on the left of the picture and my mom is on the right. She truly has shaped me to be the person I am today and her support means the world to me.
