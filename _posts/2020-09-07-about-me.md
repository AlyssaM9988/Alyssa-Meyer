# About Me
## Academic life
I grew up in Stephens City Virginia where I attended Sherando High School. GO WARRIORS! After I graduated high school I was accepted into Christopher Newport University in Newport News Virginia where I now double major in Accounting and Finance.
After my first year at CNU I got an externship at Yount Hyde and Barbour where I was then offered an accounting internship for the summer of 2021! YHB is part of my hometown and has business in several different areas including Richmond.
