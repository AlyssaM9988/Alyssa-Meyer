## Academic life

I grew up in Stephens City Virginia where I attended Sherando High School. GO WARRIORS! After I graduated high school I was accepted into Christopher Newport University in Newport News Virginia where I am now in my sophomore year and am double majoring in Accounting and Finance.

After my first year at CNU I got an externship at Yount Hyde and Barbour where I was then offered an accounting internship for the summer of 2021! YHB is part of my hometown and has business in several different areas including Richmond.
## Why I took DH
Like I said my major is Accounting and Finance and when I was looking for classes that counted towards my writing intensive credit I read the descriptions and I was looking for a class out of my comfort zone. I wanted a class that would challenge me to think in a completely different way than I would in my classes towards my major. When I found a class that required creativity and the use of technology I was automatically intrigued.
## Volunteering
Volunteering is important to me personally because I love giving back to the community that surrounds CNU. CNU has made it easy to find ways to volunteer! I volunteer a few times a week at an on-campus job. My job is at the Judy Ford Wason Center for Public Policy also known as the [Wason Center](https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter).

Here we get volunteer hours for being a student researcher. To get these volunteer hours we call randomly generated numbers and ask participants to take a non-partisan poll about different issues in the world whether it be about the next upcoming election or about environmental issues.
## Home Life
> *"You is Kind. You is Strong. You is Important."*

My life has revolved around this quote since the first time I saw the movie "The Help." Everynight before my mom would tuck me and my sister in she said this phrase to both of us. She always wanted to remind us that we were loved and that we are significant. This has shaped my life and because of my mom doing that she taught us to be confident in everything we do.
