# Reflection
For my English 350 class I was assigned to read “The Yellow Wall-paper” By Charlotte Perkins Stetson. For this assignment I was assigned page 648 and column one to code in a software called Oxygen. Oxygen is a form of TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) that helps organize documents by adding tags to certain elements including: italicizing, em-dashes, quotes, etc. 
The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of coding. When starting this project I was concerned about my lack of knowledge about coding but soon after figuring out how to use Oxygen I seemed to learn the coding fairly quickly.


Before actually using Oxygen our professor gave us a tip about how to make coding less confusing when we get to Oxygen. The tip she gave was to copy and paste our part into a document in google and go through the document and highlight any em-dashes, italicized words, or quotes. This was helpful because when you get to using Oxygen you can open up both documents and be able to know exactly what you need to code.
![This is the before hand work that was done whihc included highlighting and commenting on every part that needed to be coded](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlyssaM9988/alyssa-meyer/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-12%20at%2010.34.28%20AM.png)

Oxygen is a helpful tool that tells you when you mess up your coding. When I was doing my coding I made mistakes while trying to italicize code. When I messed up a red underline showed up underneath the spot where I had difficulties with italizing. Also in the upper right corner there was a box that would change colors from red to green based on the correctness of the coding. Green meant that the coding was correct and that you could move on while red meant that the coding was wrong. 

	
	
During the coding I had to make a decision on whether or not I had to add coding to the word “work”. This word is surrounded by quotation marks in the text. While coding you use <q> to represent the quotation marks when a person is speaking. But I decided not to add the coding to this word because no one is speaking the word. It is just in quotation marks and this would not achieve what the <q> tag is supposed to do.

I also had to figure out if any words were misspelled in “The Yellow Wall-Paper”. This was another coding decision that I needed to make. Back when this story was written words were spelled differently so when I ran into the word “draught” from the text I automatically thought that it was misspelled. If it was I would've needed to add coding to it. But after looking up the word I found that it is spelled right and it had a different meaning.
	
Though I was concerned about my lack of understanding of coding at the beginning of this project I seemed to catch on fairly quickly. During class when the professor would look over other student’s coding I would fix mine as she went on so that when she got to look at my coding there would be few mistakes involved. Between the assignment that I did beforehand when I highlighted the spots I needed to code and the use of the Oxygen software I can say that I am more confident in my coding abilities and I hope that I will learn more about coding as the course progresses.
