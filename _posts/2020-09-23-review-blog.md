 [*Two Plantations*](http://twoplantations.com) is a DH project about what it was like to be enslaved either in Virginia or Jamaica. It was created by using the tools of [Grafton Studio](https://graftonstudio.com) which helps with the web design of the project. This project shows the lineages between seven  families between two plantations in two different countries. The idea of the project is to give information about the family life of a slave. Little information is known about slave's lives but this project helps show what is known in an interesting way.

 This project had many interesting components. For example, the way that it is set up is well organized; if you click on a header towards the top it will take you to the section you are looking for. I also wanted to add that the small bite size paragraphs were awesome for an online project. It is more likely to grab the reader's attention.
 
 At the top there is a small walkthrough of information about what it was like to be a slave in those times. The project gives a lot of good information during this walkthrough and there are also many images to accompany the words. The images behind the words help draw in the reality of life back then and provides an image that helps the reader imagine what the plantations would have looked like. ![This is an example from the top where it is talking about what it was like to be enslaved at the plantation in Mount Airy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlyssaM9988/alyssa-meyer/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-21%20at%2010.08.51%20AM.png)

The handwritten family diagram is an authentic idea that was a special part of this project. Since this diagram is handwritten it can be difficult to read. There were some parts that didn't make sense like what were the green/black circles used to represent? The diagram needed a legend to show what each circle represented. But it is a nice touch to the project and is definitely interactive because you can zoom in on the diagram and you get to explore all 5 feet of family lineage!

The Family tree section is so beautifully organized and enriched with detail about each member of the family. When clicking on each of the names you learn about them and what their family situation was like when it comes to who their fathers are or if anyone even knew who they were. With a few of the ones that were picked the bottom of the information was cut off because the next section got in its way. Making it impossible to see all the information about a specific person. For example, Minny. ![Minny has a lot of information but when clicking on her name it gets cut off.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlyssaM9988/alyssa-meyer/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-21%20at%209.34.51%20AM.png)


The Male and female boxes in the family tree section were a good idea. Each shape next to the male and female box is if the person was male or female. This helps to take the guesswork out of figuring out the gender of each person. One thing I would add to it is that you should be able to click on either male or female and only that gender shows in the family tree. That would be a cool add-on to try to make the section more interactive.

The section called Family Lists has a search bar tool which is a smart add-on because it makes finding a specific person easier in each of the three lineages. When using the search bar if we look up the name Minny her name pops up with all the information about her. So the issue of not being able to see all of her description in the family tree section doesn't seem as bad now because of this function. But the issue should still be fixed in the family tree section.

In the written analysis in the project the first paragraph was concise and had a lot of details. But as you move to the second and third paragraphs it gets a little confusing. The second paragraph is full of questions which is good. But the main issue is that the questions are never answered even within the project itself. This leaves the reader more confused about the point of the project and what they have actually learned from reading it. 

This DH project has helped readers understand more about slave families in the old days and with the fun interactive portions it makes learning more interesting and hands on. The critiques given were based on the design never the information. With a few small fixes to the design this project will be more equipped to make learning about this topic easier and more fun!
