# *Two Plantations*
## A Critical Review
 [Two Plantations](http://twoplantations.com) is a DH project about what it was like to be enslaved either in The US (Virginia) or in Jamaica. This project had many interesting compenants. For example, the way that it is set up is very organized in a way that if you click on one of the headers towards the top it will take you right to the section you are looking for. I also wanted to add that the small bitesized paragraphs were awesome for an online project. It is more likely to grab the readers attention.

The hand written family diagram is really an authentic idea that was a special part of this project. Since this diagram is handwritten it can be difficult to read and some parts didnt make since like what were the green/black circles used to represent? But it is a nice touch to the project and is definitely interactive because you can zoom in on the diagram and you get to explore all 5 feet of family lineage!
