#*Two Plantations*
##A Critical Review
 [Two Plantations](http://twoplantations.com) is a DH project about what it was like to be enslaved either in The US (Virginia) or in Jamaica. This project had many interesting compenants. For example, the way that it is set up is very organized in a way that if you click on one of the headers towards the top it will take you right to the section you are looking for.
